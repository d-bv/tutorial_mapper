# Tutorial on Mapper Algorithm



In the "tutorial.ipynb" notebook we showcase the usage of the [Mapper algorithm](https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf) provided by the [Giotto](https://giotto.ai) Python library. The related article is available [here]. (TODO: add link)



To perform our analysis, we applied the algorithm on a dataset* containing 5000 3-dimensional observations sampled from a Santa Claus shape. 



\* *The dataset has been sampled from a mesh object available [here](https://free3d.com/3d-model/santa-clau-77751.html) through the usage of [CloudCompare](https://www.cloudcompare.org). The notebook "_generate_data.ipynb" shows how to generate the dataset*.
